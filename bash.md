Beginner's guide to the Bash Terminal

In working with to command line it's assume that you're already know what you're doing

command list:

ls - list storage
pwd - working directory/folders (full path/absolute path) *search relative path on google for more info
ls -a (-a is option to see all hidden files)
ls -l and ls -la
cd (change directory)
adding "\" to specific path ignore the space so you don't need to use apostrophe while changing directory
pushd
popd
